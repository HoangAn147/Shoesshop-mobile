# Shoesshop-mobile
“I developed a mobile shoe store app in Java language. Users can browse the shoes catalog, view detailed product information, add items to the cart, and place orders. I designed RecyclerView adapters to show a list of shoes dynamically, and used Java models to represent products, cart items, and orders. To persist data, I implemented a cart system so that users can save selected shoes — depending on the project, this was either stored locally or synced with backend. I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly UI using Android layouts, supporting actions like adding to cart, increasing/decreasing quantity, and checkout flow. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Android’s Activity lifecycle, Intents, data binding between UI and data models, and state management in a small e-commerce context.
